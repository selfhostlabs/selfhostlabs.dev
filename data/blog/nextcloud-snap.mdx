## Introduction

Hey Everyone, in this post we are going to learn how to self host NextCloud on Ubuntu. We are going to use snap to install the NextCloud which make the installation process very easy.

## What is NextCloud?

NextCloud is a suite of client-server software for creating and using file hosting services. It is functionally similar to Dropbox, although NextCloud is free and open-source, allowing anyone to install and operate it on a private server. In contrast to proprietary services like Dropbox, the open architecture allows adding additional functionality to the server in form of applications and enables the user to have full control of their data.

## Prerequisites

- A server running Ubuntu 20.04 or more recent. This guide will use Ubuntu 20.04.
- A non-root user with sudo privileges.
- A domain name pointed at your server's IP address.

## Installation

### Step 1: Update the system

Before we start, its always better to update the system to the latest version. You can do it by running following command

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

### Step 2: Install NextCloud

NextCloud is available as a snap package using which we can easily install it. Run the following command to install NextCloud.

```bash
sudo snap install nextcloud
```

output

```bash
nextcloud 27.1.7snap1 from Nextcloudâœ“ installed
```

Once the installation is complete, you can access the NextCloud web interface by visiting your server's IP address in your web browser. You will see following screen.

You will be asked to create a admin account. Just fill in the details and click on "Install" button. Once the installation is complete, you will be redirected the page asking to install recommended apps. You can install them if you want or skip it. You will be redirected to the NextCloud dashboard.

Here we have completed the installation of NextCloud and you can start using it. But we currently have to access it using the IP address of the server. Lets move to the next step to configure the domain name.

### Step 3: Configure the domain name

To access the NextCloud using domain name, we need to configure our DNS records for domain name to point to the server's IP address. You can do it by going to your domain registrar's website and adding an A record pointing to your server's IP address.

Make sure to change the domain name and IP address with your actual domain name and IP address.

Note: Dns records usually propagate quickly but sometimes it may take upto 24 hours to propagate. You can check the propagation status using [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net/).

### Step 4: Configure SSL

We now have everything setup but its always better to secure the website using SSL. NextCloud comes with a built-in script to generate SSL certificate using LetsEncrypt. Run the following command to generate the SSL certificate.

```bash
sudo nextcloud.enable-https lets-encrypt
```

It will ask you some questions for which you have to seect proper options and then it will generate the SSL certificate.

```bash
Have you met these requirements? (y/n) y
```

Then you will be asked to enter your email address which will be used for recovery and notifications. Make sure to enter a valid email address.

```bash
Please enter an email address (for urgent notices or key recovery): my@gmail.com
```

Then you will be asked to enter the domain name for which you want to generate the SSL certificate. Enter the domain name and press enter.

```bash
Please enter your domain name(s) (space-separated): nextcloud.selfhostlabs.dev
```

Once the SSL certificate is generated, you can access the NextCloud using the domain name and it will be secured using SSL.
