## Introduction

Hey everyone! In this post, we're going to learn how to self-host WordPress on Ubuntu using Nginx as our web server.

WordPress is the world's most popular content management system, powering over 40% of all websites. It's versatile, user-friendly, and perfect for blogs, business websites, and e-commerce platforms alike.

## Why Nginx and not Apache?

Traditionally, Apache has been the most popular web server for hosting WordPress sites. However, Nginx has gained popularity in recent years due to its performance and scalability. Nginx is known for its ability to handle high traffic loads efficiently and is often used in conjunction with other technologies like PHP-FPM to improve performance.

Here are some reasons why you might choose Nginx over Apache for hosting WordPress:

- **Performance**: Nginx is known for its speed and efficiency, especially for static content.
- **Scalability**: It's easier to scale your site as it grows.
- **Control**: You have full control over your server environment.
- **Security**: You can implement custom security measures.

Now, let's get started with the setup!

## Prerequisites

- A server running Ubuntu 22.04 or more recent. This guide will use Ubuntu 24.04.
- Domain name pointed at your server's IP address.
- Basic familiarity with command-line operations
- Root or sudo access to your server

## Installation

### Step 1: Update the system

Before we start, it's always better to update the system to the latest version. You can do it by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Step 2: Installing Nginx

First things first, we need to install Nginx:

```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```

After installation, don't forget to allow the HTTP and HTTPS traffic through the firewall. You can do it by running the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw enable
```

now you can go to your browser and enter your server's IP address. You should see the default nginx page.

/>

**Explanation**: Nginx is a powerful web server that excels at handling static content. The firewall (ufw) rules allow incoming web traffic to reach your server.

> **Good to know**: Nginx can handle more concurrent connections than Apache, making it a popular choice for high-traffic websites.

### Step 3: Installing and Securing MySQL

Next, let's set up our database:

```bash
sudo apt install mysql-server
```

Secure your MySQL installation by running:

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Follow the the prompts to secure your MySQL installation and remove insecure defauls. This setup is crucial for maintaining secure database environment.

**Explanation**: MySQL is the database that will store your WordPress content. The secure installation process helps protect your database from common vulnerabilities.

### Step 4: Installing PHP and Required Extensions

WordPress is built using PHP, so we need to install PHP along with some necessary extensions:

```bash
sudo apt install php-fpm php-mysql php-curl php-gd php-intl php-mbstring php-soap php-xml php-xmlrpc php-zip
```

**Explanation**: PHP is a server-side scripting language that WordPress uses to generate dynamic content. The extensions provide additional functionality that WordPress needs to run properly.

### Step 5: Setting Up the WordPress Database

log into MySQL as the root user:

```bash
sudo mysql -u root -p
```

Now run the following sql qeuries to create a new database and user for WordPress:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
CREATE USER 'wordpressuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_strong_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO 'wordpressuser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

**Explanation**: These commands create a new database called `wordpress`, a new user called `wordpressuser`, and grant the user full access to the database. Make sure to replace `your_strong_password` with a secure password.

### Step 6: Downloading and Configuring WordPress

Download the latest version of WordPress and extract it to the web root directory:

```bash
cd /tmp
wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar xzvf latest.tar.gz
sudo mv wordpress /var/www/html/
```

Set the correct permissions on the WordPress files:

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/wordpress
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/wordpress
```

### Step 7: Configuring Nginx for WordPress

Create and open a new Nginx configuration file for your WordPress site:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/wordpress
```

Add the following configuration to the file:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain.com www.your_domain.com;
    root /var/www/html/wordpress;
    index index.php index.html index.htm;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

    location = /favicon.ico {
        log_not_found off;
        access_log off;
    }

    location = /robots.txt {
        log_not_found off;
        access_log off;
        allow all;
    }

    location ~* \.(css|gif|ico|jpeg|jpg|js|png)$ {
        expires max;
        log_not_found off;
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: This Nginx configuration file tells Nginx how to serve your WordPress site. Make sure to replace `your_domain.com` with your actual domain name.

Enable the configuration:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/wordpress /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

**Explanation**: his Nginx configuration tells the server how to handle requests for your WordPress site, including PHP processing and static file handling.

> **Good to know**: The `try_files` directive in the Nginx config enables WordPress permalinks, allowing for SEO-friendly URLs.

### Step 8: Completing the WordPress Installation

Now, open your web browser and navigate to `http://your_domain.com`. You should see the WordPress installation page assking to select language like this one:

Fill in the details and click on the "Install WordPress" button. Once the installation is complete, you will be redirected given the option to login to the WordPress dashboard.

**Explanation**: The WordPress installation wizard guides you through the process of setting up your WordPress site, including database configuration and site details.

### Step 9: Configuring HTTPS with Let's Encrypt

To secure your WordPress site with HTTPS, you can use Let's Encrypt to obtain an SSL certificate. First, install Certbot:

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

Next, obtain the SSL certificate for your domain:

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx
```

This command will automatically find domains configured in Nginx and obtain an SSL certificate for them. Follow the prompts to complete the process.

**Explanation**: Let's Encrypt provides free SSL certificates that enable HTTPS for your site. The Certbot tool automates the process of obtaining and installing these certificates.

> **Fun Fact:** Let's Encrypt, the certificate authority used by Certbot, has issued over a billion free SSL certificates since its launch in 2015.

### Step 10: Finalizing the Setup

After configuring HTTPS, you need to update your WordPress site URL to use `https`. You can do this by logging into the WordPress dashboard, navigating to `Settings > General`, and updating the `WordPress Address (URL)` and `Site Address (URL)` fields to use `https`.

<Image
